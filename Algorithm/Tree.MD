### Common Solution
For most of tree related  question, there are usually 2 solutions
- recursive: usually DFS. Easy but stackoverflow possible
- iterative: usually BFS. Using queue, stack.

For BST:
- There are many properties of BST that can be used.

### Questions:

#### 1 Traversal: 
preorder, inorder, postorder:
- 3 ways: recursive iterative hashmap  

level order(bottom-top, zigzag):
- iterative: (bfs)stack   
- recursive: (dfs)

question with help of traversal: 	
- Next Right Pointers, path Sum, Sum Root to Leaf, Binary Tree Path
	
#### 2 Check and Compare:
Same tree, Symmetric tree, balanced tree

#### 3 Deep:
Max deep, Min deep

#### 4 Construct tree:
From inorder with pre or post

Invert tree

Construct from a sorted array

flatten the tree to linked-list

#### 5 BST:
kth smallest
