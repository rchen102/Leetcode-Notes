## Basic

**Def**: A simple linked list is a data structure that is built up from nodes. Each node has a payload - the data that the node carries, and a pointer to the next node. 

**Why**: Handle situation when Array/Dynamical Arayy perform not well

## Implement

### (1) Single linked list
Linked list in which every node only has a next pointer

### (2) Double linked list
Linked list in which every node has a next pointer and a previous pointer

Traversal can be more efficient, but code becomes more complex, more chance for bugs

### (3) Circular linked list
Linked list in which last node points to the first node
