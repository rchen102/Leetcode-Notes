## 94 Inorder, 144 Preoreder, 145 Postorder
Recursive way is easiest

If required to use iterative, hashmap is first choice, then just use stack

### Solution1: recursive  
T: O(n) S: O(n) worst

The easiest way to do shuch a thing. But be careful about the size, for stackoverflow
	
### Solution2: HashMap
T: O(n) S: O(n) worst

By help of hashmap, we can easily build a template for all 3 traversal
	
### Solution3: Iterative
Tï¼š O(n) S: O(n) worst

The in order and post order should take care
